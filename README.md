# 🌱 Air Quality Prediction Project

This project predicts air pollutant levels using a trained Machine Learning model and provides an interactive **Streamlit app** for predictions.

## 📊 Features
✅ Advanced data cleaning and preprocessing  
✅ Visual exploration of data (correlations, distributions)  
✅ Model selection with Random Forest and Gradient Boosting  
✅ Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV  
✅ Evaluation using R², MAE, RMSE  
✅ Feature importance visualization  
✅ Streamlit web app for predictions
