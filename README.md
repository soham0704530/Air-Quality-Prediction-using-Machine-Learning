🌱 Air Quality Prediction Project
This project predicts air pollutant levels using a trained Machine Learning model and provides an interactive Streamlit app for easy, real-time predictions.

Air pollution is one of the world’s biggest environmental challenges, impacting public health, climate, and ecosystems. Accurate prediction of air quality helps policymakers, city planners, and the public to make informed decisions, reduce exposure, and plan mitigation strategies.

This project demonstrates how data science and machine learning can be applied to solve real-world environmental problems, using historical air quality data and a user-friendly web interface.

📊 Features
✅ Advanced data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, scaling, outlier detection)
✅ Visual exploration of data (correlation heatmaps, feature distributions)
✅ Model selection using ensemble algorithms (Random Forest and Gradient Boosting)
✅ Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV for better accuracy
✅ Model evaluation using key metrics: R², MAE, RMSE
✅ Feature importance analysis to understand what drives predictions
✅ Simple and interactive Streamlit web app for predictions without coding
✅ Fully reproducible and easy-to-deploy pipeline

💡 About the Project
Air quality is measured by sensors that record pollutants like NOx, CO, NO₂, PM₂.₅, etc., along with weather-related data.
This project takes those historical sensor readings and builds a predictive model that learns the patterns and relationships in the data.

Once trained, the model can forecast future pollutant levels based on new input data.
The Streamlit app allows anyone — even without coding skills — to upload new sensor data and instantly get predictions in an intuitive, web-based interface.

This project is a good example of combining:

Data Engineering (cleaning, preprocessing)

Machine Learning (training and evaluation)

Visualization (EDA and feature insights)

Deployment (Streamlit app)

It shows the end-to-end workflow of a typical data science project.

📜 Why is this important?
✅ Helps raise awareness about the dangers of air pollution
✅ Provides a low-cost tool for monitoring and forecasting air quality
✅ Demonstrates how ML can be applied to environmental and sustainability challenges
✅ Open-source and easy to adapt to other similar datasets or use cases

🚀 How it Works
1️⃣ Data is cleaned, missing values are filled, and features are scaled
2️⃣ The dataset is split into training and testing sets
3️⃣ Two models — Random Forest and Gradient Boosting — are trained and tuned
4️⃣ The best-performing model is saved
5️⃣ A Streamlit app allows users to upload their own data and see predictions instantly
